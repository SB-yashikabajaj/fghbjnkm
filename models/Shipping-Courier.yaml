  Essential information for tracking a shipment. The `shippedAt` key represents the date and time when the item was shipped. This value follows the [ISO 8601 standard format](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) for date and time representations.

  The `name` field indicates the courier service employed to handle the shipment (e.g. FEDEX, UPS). For orders that are picked up in-store (also known as Buy-Online-Pickup-Instore), please use "INSTORE_PICKUP" as the `name` field value.

  The `tracking` key represents a unique tracking number provided by the courier service to monitor the shipment's progress. It's a valuable tool for customers and businesses to track and trace their packages.

  The `priority` field tracks the shipping speed or service level associated with the delivery.

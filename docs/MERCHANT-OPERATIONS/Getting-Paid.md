# Getting Paid

**I am a merchant, when will I get paid?**

---

Settlement payments are processed 1-5 business days after the order date.

Banks typically take an additional day or two to deposit the settlement into your company account.

## Settlement Timing

In the US our settlement process is based on Pacific Time (PST) / Pacific Daylight Time (PDT). So each settlement report includes all transactions processed the previous day ending at midnight PST.

## Merchant Fees

Cash App Afterpay merchant fees are deducted from each transaction prior to settlement payout.

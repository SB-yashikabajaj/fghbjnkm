**How can I manually process refunds?**

> Always process refunds through your eCommerce platform. Any refunds processed in the Business Hub are not visible in your eCommerce platform, and you will need to manually reconcile them.

After opening an order in the Business Hub an **ISSUE REFUND** button appears.

You can make partial and full refunds up to the order total. You must enter your password to confirm the refund

<!-- theme: warning -->

> You cannot refund more than the original order amount.

When the refund is complete it shows the Cash App Afterpay order page. A line item called `Less Returns` under the *Order total* shows the amount of the refund.

# Searching Orders

**How can I find orders in the Business Hub**
---

You can search from your Orders tab individual orders either with the order/customer information OR by searching a date range using the From and To fields.

## Shopify

If you are a Shopify merchant, you may wonder why does the merchant order number not match my order number?

The answer is you must search for the Shopify Transaction number, not the Shopify Order Number. See our dedicated [Shopify Order Reconciliation](../PLATFORMS/Shopify/Shopify-Order-Reconciliation.md) page for more information on matching orders between the two systems.

# Payment Schedule


## How Does the Payment Schedule Work?

In most cases, customers must make their first payment at the time of purchase. The remaining three payments are due every two weeks in equal installments and are drawn from the customer's selected payment method. If customers want to make any extra unscheduled early payments, they can log in to Cash App Afterpay to make these early payments.

Customers can log into the Cash App Afterpay account anytime to view their payment schedule or make an early payment.

## Can Merchants View Payment Schedules?

Cash App Afterpay accepts all the risk of payment from our mutual customers, and merchant settlements are not affected by the customer’s payments. Customer payments and schedules are not visible to merchants.

## Are Customers Notified When a Payment is Due?

Cash App Afterpay sends payment reminders by SMS and email before payments are due. It is also easy to view customer orders and payment schedules on Afterpay.com or in the Cash App Afterpay App.

## Can Customers Pay Early?

Yes, customers can make payments any time through their Cash App Afterpay account before the scheduled due date. Customers click the installment that they want to pay early and select ‘Pay Now.’

## Can Customers Move or Change Payment Due Dates for an Order?

To request an adjusted payment schedule, customers should contact Cash App Afterpay’s Customer Service team. The team reviews the customer account and request to determine eligibility. Not all requests are successful.

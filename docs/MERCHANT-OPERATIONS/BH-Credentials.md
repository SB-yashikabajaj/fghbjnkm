# Business Hub Credentials

As a *Hub Admin* (Business Hub administrator), you have secure access to your merchant credentials within the Business Hub. 

Go to the *Settings* tab to find all the necessary information. Your direct link to the Settings tab is: https://hub.us.afterpay.com/settings. 

Without *Hub Admin* permissions, you can still view the Merchant ID field.

# Refunds and Exchanges

**How are refunds processed with Cash App Afterpay?**

---

## Refunds, Returns and Exchanges

Refunds for customers who used the Cash App Afterpay payment option follow your brandâ€™s standard return policy. Funds are first refunded from you to the designated Cash App Afterpay account, and then onto the customer.

Once the refund is processed to the Cash App Afterpay account, the refund is then processed to the payment card or cards associated with the payment installment or installments. 

For this reason, never offer an exchange, cash refund or store credit for Cash App Afterpay orders. If you process a refund in any of these ways, confusing situations can occur. Instead, always inform us of the need for a refund and Cash App Afterpay will do the refund processing.

Once the refund is processed with Cash App Afterpay, the customer Cash App Afterpay payment plan is adjusted to reflect the new total order value. This value is calculated starting with the last payment and working backward.

If your customers contact us about a refund, we always recommended that they contact you, the merchant, for cancellations and/or refund requests.

## Order Modifications

Once Cash App Afterpay has approved an order, order details cannot be modified, and items cannot be added to the order. We encourage customers to place a new, and separate order if they would like to add additional items to their purchase.

# Unsuccessful Orders

**Why was a customer's order unsuccessful?**

----

Cash App Afterpay is committed to supporting responsible spending. 

If an order fails Cash App Afterpay’s order assessment criteria, the customer is directed back to your website’s checkout page. As this occurs the customer is notified that the order has not been approved. The customer can then try again, or use a different payment method to complete the purchase.

Our rules and approval process are in place to help Cash App Afterpay responsibly offer a completely free service to our customers. Cash App Afterpay does not approve 100% of orders, but we do make a fresh assessment each time a customer attempts an order with us.

If the customer requests further details you can direct them to visit [help.afterpay.com](https://help.afterpay.com/) or contact [Cash App Afterpay Customer Support](../FAQS-AND-SUPPORT/caa-support.md)

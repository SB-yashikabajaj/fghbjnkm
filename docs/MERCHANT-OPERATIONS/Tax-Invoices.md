**How Can I download a tax invoice?**

Our tax invoice option allows you to download monthly invoices for tax reporting purposes. If you are attempting to reconcile your settlements, use the *Settlement Export* option.

To download a tax invoice:

1. Login to the Business Hub, and click the **TAX INVOICE** button, under the *Reconciliation* tab. A window appears that allows you to configure the details of your settlement report.

## Add the Messaging to the Product Pages

    ![shop-message-app-1.png](../../../assets/images/shop-message-app-1.png)

2. From the app's *Add Messaging* section, click [Open Theme Editor](https://accounts.shopify.com/lookup?rid=cb901599-a4cd-4d01-9e88-e70243d0636c).

    > **How Messaging Works**
    >
    > Messaging works on Product Page templates. So if you have a single Product Page template, you add messaging to that template. If you have several different Product Page templates, then you'll need to add messaging to each one separately.

5. Move your mouse over the Product price, a + symbol appears.

5. Enter a name for this new template. See the picture below:

    ![hide-message-3-new.png](../../../assets/images/hide-message-3-new.png)

Do the following:

1. Go to [Shopify admin](https://accounts.shopify.com/lookup?rid=d3c85713-691d-405c-a958-bde97cbf383e) and select *Products*.

2. Use the Search filter to find the product that you don't want to associate with Afterpay messaging. You can also find this product from the list of existing products. See the picture below:

    ![hide-message-4-new.png](../../../assets/images/hide-message-4-new.png)

3. In the Online store section, open the drop-down menu and select the new theme template you created. Then apply this new template to the product. See picture below:

    ![hide-message-5-new.png](../../../assets/images/hide-message-5-new.png)

4. Repeat step 3 for all the products that you don't want to associate with Afterpay messaging. Click **Save** when you have finished

5. Go back to On-Site Messaging App and open the *Theme Editor*.

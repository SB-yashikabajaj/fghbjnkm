# Updating the Cash App Afterpay Module

Cash App Afterpay periodically updates its Cash App Afterpay module. 

There are two ways to ensure your module is up-to-date:

* [Use the PrestaShop Marketplace](#use-the-prestashop-marketplace)

* [Use the Module Manager updating tool](#use-the-module-manager-updating-tool)

> We strongly recommend that you always use the latest version of the Cash App Afterpay module.

## Use the PrestaShop Marketplace

When a new version of the Cash App Afterpay module is released on the PrestaShop Marketplace, the PrestaShop store should detect the new version. The PrestaShop store automatically shows the upgrade option.

To upgrade, to the following:

1. Go to the *Module Manager* section on the left menu bar. See the picture below:

4. Ensure you have a backup of the site before any upgrade. Click **Go to maintenance page** to avoid possible cache issues. Click **Upgrade Anyway** if you have a backup of the site and are confident you can problem solve if necessary.

When the upgrade is finished you receive a confirmation message. The **Actions** button shows the regular options.

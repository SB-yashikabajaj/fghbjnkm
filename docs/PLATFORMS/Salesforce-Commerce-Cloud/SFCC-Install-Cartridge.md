# Install the Cartridge and Import the Metadata

<!-- theme: info-->
> **Note**
>
> The SFCC cartridge and the Business Manager call Cash App Afterpay by the single word Afterpay. This doesn't affect any of the instructions or advice below.

If you are a new merchant and do not have the Cash App Afterpay cartridge installed on your site, do the following:

1. Download the cartridge

   * The current version of the cartridge is available directly from [Cash App Afterpay](https://github.com/afterpay/afterpay-salesforce-commerce-cloud) 
   * It’s also hosted on Salesforce’s [AppExchange platform](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000R8GgbEAF&tab=e)


2. Build the client-side Resources. These are the client-side CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JS (JavaScript) files that are specific to Cash App Afterpay; this is a required step.

    * Confirm that `package.json` contains the correct reference to the location of the SFRA base cartridge (Only for SFRA):

3. Set the path. Set the path to the base cartridge of SFCC which is required for the Cash App Afterpay cartridge to work.

    ```
    "paths": {
    "base": "../storefront-reference-architecture/cartridges/app_storefront_base/"
    },
    ```

4. Install/Run commands. These commands install the node in our cartridge onto your local storage and compiles the JS and CSS files residing in our cartridge.

    ```
    $ npm install
    $ npm run compile:js
    $ npm run compile:scss
    ```

5. Import the cartridge. Use **UX Studio** to import the cartridge. Alternatively, you can also use **Node Package Manager (npm)** and run **uploadCartridge**, or the **VSCode Prophet** plugin.

Once you have completed the five steps above, you are ready to import the metadata. See the section below.

## Import the Metadata

For the Cash App Afterpay integration to work, the following object structures (metadata) must be imported and configured in the **Business Manager**. Do the following:

1. In the cartridge bundle go to the folder *metadata/afterpay-meta-import/sites*.

2. Rename the *RefArch* folder to the ID of your site. You can find the site ID in *Administration* > *Sites* > *Manage Sites* in the *Business Manager*.

3. Compress the  *afterpay-meta-import* folder to generate the `afterpay-meta-import.zip` file.

4. In the *Business Manager*, go to *Administration* > *Site Development* > *Site Import & Export* and import the zipped file.

Once you have imported the metadata, you are ready to make some final checks. See the section below.

## Check For File Conflicts/Changes.

1. If you are using *SiteGenesis*, see the [SiteGenesis code changes](SFCC-SiteGenesis.md) page to add Cash App Afterpay-specific code changes to your base store cartridges. 

2. If you are using *SFRA*, see the [SFRA Files change review](SFCC-SFRA.md) page to see the files that override the files in the base cartridge.

# SiteGenesis Code Changes

To integrate the new Cash App Afterpay cartridge, you must modify your version of the SiteGenesis base cartridge files. 

If you have made considerable changes to the SiteGenesis base cartridge files for your own store, consider using a merge tool. A three-way visual merge tool such as [Meld](https://meldmerge.org/) can be useful to make these changes.

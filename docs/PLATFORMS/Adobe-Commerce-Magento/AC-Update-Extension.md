# Adobe Commerce - Update Extension

**How can I update my Adobe Commerce Extension?**

---

The Cash App Afterpay extension update method depends on how you, the merchant, have originally installed the Cash App Afterpay module. 

If you used [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install the Cash App Afterpay module, then use Composer to update it. If you used a manual process to install the Cash App Afterpay module, then use a [manual update](#manual-update) to update it.

The Cash App Afterpay extension update process depends on whether you want to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to make the update, or do a [manual update](#manual-update). We recommend that you [update with Composer](#update-with-composer).

In either case, backup your system files before you start an update.

## Manual Update

This method does not use Composer. It is more complex than using Composer, but just as effective when done correctly. Follow the instructions below.

### Remove old Afterpay files/folders

<!--theme: info-->
> **Note**
>
> In the instructions below, the `[ADOBE-COMMERCE]` folder refers to the root folder where Adobe Commerce/Magento is installed.

1. Remove all the files in: `[ADOBE-COMMERCE]/app/code/Afterpay/Afterpay`. Then you are ready to download the Cash App Afterpay Extension.

### Download the Cash App Afterpay Extension

The extension is on GitHub. Do the following:

1. Go to GitHub for the link to [Magento 2](https://github.com/afterpay/afterpay-magento-2). The source code needed depends on your version of Magento. For these details, see the [Readme file](https://github.com/afterpay/afterpay-magento-2#readme).

2. Under the green *<> Code* heading, click **Download ZIP**. See screenshot below:

![adobe-comm-manual-install.png](../../../assets/images/adobe-comm-manual-install.png)

3. Unzip your files and put them into a temporary folder.

> ðŸ“˜ Install Folder
> 
> You can install Adobe Commerce in any folder on your server. In this guide, `[ADOBE-COMMERCE]` is the name of the root folder where Adobe Commerce is installed.

### Run the Commands

1. Copy the files from your temporary folder to the `[ADOBE-COMMERCE]/app/code/Afterpay/Afterpay` folder. The temporary folder is the one you created in Step 3 in the *Download the Cash App Afterpay Extension* section above.

2. Open the Command Line Interface (CLI) and make sure you are the owner of the `[ADOBE-COMMERCE]` folder. Run all CLI commands as the owner of the folder, not `root` and without `sudo`.

3. From the CLI, run the commands below:

| Command                                         | Description                                   |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| php bin/magento module:enable Afterpay_Afterpay | Enable Cash App Afterpay extension.|        
| php bin/magento setup:upgrade                   | Adobe Commerce setup upgrade.                  |
| php bin/magento setup:di:compile                | Adobe Commerce dependencies injection compile. |
| php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy     | Adobe Commerce static content deployment.     |
| php bin/magento cache:flush                     | Adobe Commerce system cache flush.          |

Now you need to repeat the process for the *Cash App Pay Extension for Magento 2*:

1. Remove the existing files in the `[ADOBE-COMMERCE]/app/code/Afterpay/CashApp` folder.

2. Download and copy the files to the `[ADOBE-COMMERCE]/app/code/Afterpay/CashApp` folder. The source code path is based on the Magento version [here](https://github.com/afterpay/cash-app-pay-magento-2).

3. Open the Command Line Interface (CLI) and run the commands below:

| Command                                         | Description                                   |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| php bin/magento module:enable Afterpay_CashApp | Enable the Cash App Pay extension.                     |
| php bin/magento setup:upgrade                   | Adobe Commerce setup upgrade.                  |
| php bin/magento setup:di:compile                | Adobe Commerce dependencies injection compile. |
| php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy     | Adobe Commerce static content deployment.     |
| php bin/magento cache:flush                    | Adobe Commerce system cache flush.          |

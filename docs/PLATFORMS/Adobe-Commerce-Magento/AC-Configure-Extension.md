<!-- theme: warning -->

> **Warning**
>
> In the table above, we do not recommend the use of the Auto-Reversals feature if you use an external Order Management System (OMS).

## Advanced Frontend Settings

Use these settings for custom-built themes on your website. The default of these settings is NO (disabled), which means your pages display in the default Adobe Commerce Luma theme, or similar. 

These custom-built themes are not dependent on [Knockout.js](https://knockoutjs.com), which is the default frontend framework included with Adobe Commerce. If enabled, Advanced Frontend Settings allow Afterpay messaging to display on the product page, cart and mini-cart, regardless of the frontend framework used by your theme. 

You, the merchant, must configure the Placement selectors and the Price selectors according to the theme you have designed and your web page type.

<!-- theme: info-->
> **Note**
>
> This feature is only available for Adobe Commerce 2.4 (and above) users.

Do the following:

1. Login to Adobe Commerce Admin and go to  **Stores → Configuration → Sales → Payment Methods → Afterpay** (scroll down).

2. Click **Advanced Frontend Settings**. The advanced frontend settings fields display, in the default setting of No, which means they are disabled. See screenshot below:

The example screen below shows the range of settings when the advanced frontend settings fields are enabled:

# Older Messaging Information

## New Merchants

We recommend that all new merchants use our current [On-Site Messaging](Getting-Started-with-Afterpay-On-Site-Messaging.md) product. 

## Existing Cash App Afterpay Merchants

We currently support two messaging products. 

[On-Site Messaging](Getting-Started-with-Afterpay-On-Site-Messaging.md) is our current messaging product, and our previous product is messaging from the [JavaScript Library](JavaScript-Library.md).

If you want to migrate from the JavaScript Library messaging to the current On-Site messaging product, see the information on the [Upgrade to On-Site Messaging](Migration.md) page.

### Transition from Afterpay to Cash App Afterpay

**On-Site Messaging**

If you use On-Site Messaging, it will be updated automatically.

**JavaScript Library**

If you use the JavaScript library for your messaging, it will be updated automatically.

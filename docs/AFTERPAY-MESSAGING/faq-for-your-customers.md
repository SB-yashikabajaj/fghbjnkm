## About Cash App Afterpay

**What is Cash App Afterpay?**

Cash App Afterpay is a service that allows us to offer our customers the ability to make purchases now and pay for them over time. Customers using the pay-in-4 option pay for their purchase total in four interest‑free installments over six weeks. And customers get additional time to pay for high value orders when they use the monthly payments option, an installment‑based lending product. To learn more, visit [www.afterpay.com](http://www.afterpay.com).

**How do I use Cash App Afterpay?**

Just shop on YourWebsite.com and checkout as usual. At checkout, choose Cash App Afterpay as your payment method. Log in or create an account and complete your order—it’s that easy!

Please note, all items in your shopping bag must be eligible for Cash App Afterpay, and the order value must be between \[$min] and \[$max].

**Are there extra fees when I use Cash App Afterpay?**

Cash App Afterpay’s pay‑in‑4 option is always interest‑free. There are no fees associated with the account as long as installments are paid on time, according to the payment schedule (provided at the time of order confirmation).

A late fee may be charged when an installment for an order is not paid within 10 days after the payment due date (unless otherwise noted on your payment schedule). Cash App Afterpay will only ever charge up to one late fee per installment and the total amount of late fees charged on an order will never exceed 25% of your initial order value (unless indicated otherwise on your payment confirmation email or during the checkout process).

Although this 10‑day grace period is provided before Cash App Afterpay charges a late fee, the Cash App Afterpay system reviews customer repayment history for future purchases, so Cash App Afterpay encourages payment of your installment as soon as possible.

Cash App Afterpay's longer term monthly payments option may include interest. If your installment loan includes interest, you will be able to see the amount you will owe before completing the purchase. Interest is capped and there are no late fees, loan origination fees, or other fees.

You can log in to your Cash App Afterpay account any time to view the payment schedule or to make a payment before the next due date.

**Will I be notified when a payment is due?**

## Orders, Returns and Exchanges

**When will my items be delivered if I use Cash App Afterpay?**

Cash App Afterpay orders are delivered pursuant to delivery time frames presented by \[YourName] after you complete your order online.

**How do I return or exchange an item purchased using Cash App Afterpay?**

Cash App Afterpay returns follow \[YourName]'s standard return process. Once the refund is processed by \[YourName], your Cash App Afterpay payment schedule is adjusted to reflect the new total order value starting with the last installment and working backwards. Therefore, you may find that your payments that are the furthest out have been reduced to zero, and the closest payments remain at the original value.

- **For Monthly Payments Purchases:**\
  If you are fully returning items and a refund is owed, any amounts paid towards the good or service will be refunded; any interest that has already been paid will not be refunded. You may be charged interest for the period of time before your refund is processed.

If you believe there is fault or concern with your Cash App Afterpay purchase payment, please contact Cash App Afterpay customer support at <info@afterpay.com>.

For more information on returns and refunds, visit [Cash App Afterpay's Help Center](https://help.afterpay.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001002192-I-m-a-Customer).

**What happens if I have a partial refund, and how does that affect my payments?**

Cash App Afterpay will be notified once your refund is processed.

- **For Pay‑in‑4 Purchases:**\
  Your payment plan will be automatically adjusted to reflect the new total order value starting with the last payment and working backward. In the case where a refund amount is larger than 25% of the total order, Cash App Afterpay will eliminate the fourth installment payment and apply the remaining amount to your earlier payments.

- **For Monthly Payments Purchases:**\
  Interest already paid will not be refunded. Any amounts paid toward the good or service will be adjusted; interest will be recalculated based upon the adjusted amount.

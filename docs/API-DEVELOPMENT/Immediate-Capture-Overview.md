# Immediate Capture Overview

## Scope

Immediate Capture allows a merchant to capture funds from a customer at checkout or shortly after checkout.

Immediate Capture is supported on all platforms and integrations.

For details on support for Immediate Capture within an Afterpay Direct API (v2 API) integration, please refer to [Immediate Payment Flow](../../docs/ONLINE-API/Immediate-Payment-Flow.md).

## Customer Experience

After logging in or quickly creating a Cash App Afterpay customer account, a customer will approve the payment schedule.

## Business Hub

A merchant can search for and view individual transactions, showing the settlement status of the transaction and may perform refunds directly from the transaction view.  A merchant can also download settlement files from the Business Hub to aid in reconciliation.

For more details on the Business Hub, see the [Business Hub](../MERCHANT-OPERATIONS/Merchant-Portal-Access.md) topics.

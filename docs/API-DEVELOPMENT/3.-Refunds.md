# Refunds
**How can I process a refund or return with Cash App Afterpay?**

---

- [POST /v2/payments/{orderid}/refund](https://developers.cash.app/docs/merchant/reference/payments/operations/create-a-v-2-payment-refund)

Make a full refund or partial refunds (up to the original order total) based on your refund or cancellation policies. You can use the same Cash App Afterpay Payment ID for multiple partial refunds.

Refunds can be used for:

* Full or partial order cancellation for the [direct capture payment flow](https://developers.cash.app/docs/merchant/api-development/api-calls-payment-flows/direct-capture)

* Returns

* Other scenarios where you want to issue funds back to the customer

* Refunds cannot be issued after 120 days from the date of purchase. After 120 days, refund requests are rejected and return a 422 error.

You can also process [manual refunds](../MERCHANT-OPERATIONS/Manual-Refunds.md) from the Cash App Afterpay [Business Hub](API-Merchant-Portal.md).

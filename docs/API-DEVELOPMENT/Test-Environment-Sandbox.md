# Test Environment (Sandbox)

**How can I test my Cash App Afterpay API Integration?**

---

Cash App Afterpay provides a sandbox for development and testing. The sandbox environment is:

* Accessed using a [different URL](../ONLINE-API/API-Environments.md)

* Uses different credentials to a production environment.

**How Can I Get Sandbox Credentials?**

Speak to your Cash App Afterpay account manager to obtain sandbox credentials for your region.

Accounts created within an Cash App Afterpay sandbox only exist within that sandbox, and no money actually moves when payments are made.

The Cash App Afterpay Sandbox environment includes the following components that mirror the Production environment:

* [Sandbox API Endpoint](../ONLINE-API/API-Environments.md) for development and testing

* [Sandbox Customer Account](Customer-Accounts.md) with Cash App Afterpay signup and account management capabilities

* [Sandbox Business Hub](API-Merchant-Portal.md) for viewing orders and settlement reports

# Setup Billing Agreement Approval

_Set up a Billing Agreement ready for creation_

A billing agreement is a contract between the merchant and the customer. Afterpay sets the agreement that authorises the merchant to create and pay for orders. This step sets up the Billing Agreement ready for it to be created.

The process starts with the following POST:

`POST /v2/billing-agreements/approvals`

This offers billing agreement terms to the customer for them to accept or reject. Assuming they accept the billing agreement terms, the flow continues. A sample request is:

```http
POST https://api.afterpay.com/v2/billing-agreements/approvals HTTP/1.1
Host: api.afterpay.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
```

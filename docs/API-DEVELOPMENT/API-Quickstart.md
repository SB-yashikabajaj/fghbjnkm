# API Quickstart

*What do I need to start building a direct API Integration?*
---

Use our API to integrate Cash App Afterpay with any system or custom platform.

1. **Get Sandbox Credentials:** Speak to your Cash App Afterpay account manager to coordinate the receipt of your Sandbox credentials. You need these credentials for the development and testing of your connection to our Sandbox environment.

2. [**Choose Your Preferred Payment Flow:**](API-Calls-and-Payment-Flows.md) Cash App Afterpay supports the ability to capture funds at the time of order or at the time of shipping.

3. [**Start Testing:**](Test-Environment-Sandbox.md) Download our postman collection or use our API explorer to start testing the Cash App Afterpay calls before integrating with your systems.

4. **It's time to Launch** ðŸš€: Complete certification testing and get your live credentials.

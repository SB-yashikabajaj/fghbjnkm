# Certification

**How can I get my API integration tested?**

---

When youâ€™ve passed your internal QA testing, you are ready for Cash App Afterpay Certification. Contact your Cash App Afterpay account manager to schedule certification testing.

Testing is done on each unique environment you will have in production. The test suite includes three areas:

* Integration Standards

* Customer Experience

* Refunds

Certification ensures a great customer experience, minimizes the potential for fraudulent activity, and checks for common compliance and technical issues.

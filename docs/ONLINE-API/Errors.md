### Example errors

#### GET requests
With the exception of [Ping](../../reference/Service-Status.v2.yaml/paths/~1ping/get), which doesn't require authentication, all GET endpoints can return the following errors:

| HTTP status | Error code     | Description                      |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| 401 Unauthorized      | `unauthorized` | Invalid merchant API credentials were passed in the `Authorization` header.   |
| 405 Method Not Allowed | `method_not_allowed` | The request was made by a method other than `GET`, `HEAD`, or `OPTIONS`. |
| 406 Not Acceptable  | `error`        | The request included an `Accept` header for something other than `application/json` or `*/*`.    |

#### POST / PUT requests
All PUT and POST endpoints can return any of the following errors:

| HTTP status | Error code          | Description                                                                                                                           |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 400 Bad Request | `invalid_json`       | The request body contains invalid or improperly formatted JSON.                                                                         |

| 405 Method Not Allowed | `method_not_allowed` | The request used an unsupported HTTP method. Only `PUT` or `POST` may be allowed, depending on the endpoint. Use `OPTIONS` to check.   |
| 406 Not Acceptable | `error`              | The `Accept` header was not set to `application/json` or `*/*`.                                                                         |

| 500 Internal Server Error | `error`              | Often caused by a missing or empty request body in `PUT` or `POST` requests.                                                            |

# Cash App Afterpay API introduction

The Cash App Afterpay API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). The API uses predictable, resource-oriented URLs and uses HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

- All communication must use TLS 1.2 or higher.
- The API supports [idempotency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence), which guarantees that if a request is retried, the operation is performed only once. This is especially important for partial refunds.
  > Afterpay recommends using UUIDs as `requestId` values. For most endpoints, requests with the same `requestId` will return the same response for up to 24 hours. Refund requests are an exception â€” they support idempotency for longer than 24 hours.
  >
  > If an idempotent request returns an HTTP 409, it means the original request is still being processed. Retry the request with the same requestId until a different response is returned.
- API call response times can vary, especially when requests rely on downstream banking networks. All idempotent resources can be safely retried if a timeout occurs. 
- All dates are represented in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, and are stored and returned in UTC. You can provide dates in UTC (e.g. `2025-01-01T13:25:00Z`) or with a time zone offset (e.g. `2025-01-01T23:25:00+10:00` for AEST).

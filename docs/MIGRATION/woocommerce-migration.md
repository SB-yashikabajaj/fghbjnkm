# WooCommerce Migration

If you are on a lower version than this, please update. See the [Update Plugin](#update-plugin) section below if you're not sure how to upgrade your plugin to the latest version.

If you are on the minimum or higher version, existing settings and configurations continue to work as before; there is no need to change them.

## Brand Assets

There are new Cash App Afterpay brand assets to use at checkout and across your site. See the [Brand Assets](../MARKETING/Brand-Assets.md) page in this guide for these new assets.

The table below has examples of the changes:

| | Afterpay | Cash App Afterpay |
-------|----------|---------
| Logos | <img src="../../assets/images/ap-logo-resized.png" style="all: unset; width: 150px;" /> | <img src="../../assets/images/caap-white-logo-resized.png" style="all: unset; width: 150px;" />

Any custom messaging updates must be reviewed by your Account Manager.

## Messaging

Messaging is automatically updated if you use On-Site Messaging, our current messaging product, or its predecessor that used the JavaScript library for messaging. In both cases wait for the automatic update process to occur. Monitor your email for advance notice of this automatic update.

See the table below for an example of the changes:

| Afterpay | Cash App Afterpay
|----------|---------
| <img src="../../assets/images/ap-mess-2.png" style="all: unset; width: 250px;" /> | <img src="../../assets/images/caap-mess-1.png" style="all: unset; width: 250px;" /> |

The automatic Messaging update includes changes to *learn more*/lightbox asset if you use that.

If you use elements of Afterpay Messaging but not the standard Onsite Messaging Widget, then update the Afterpay elements with new Cash App Afterpay elements. See the [Brand Assets](#brand-assets) section above.

Any custom messaging updates must be reviewed by your Account Manager.

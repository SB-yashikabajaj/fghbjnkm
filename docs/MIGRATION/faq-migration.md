## Migration Requirements

#### Why is Afterpay changing its checkout experience?

Afterpay is becoming more easily accessible to Cash App users as part of Afterpay’s integration with Cash App. 

This means we're changing the Afterpay logo where it appears on your site to attract the 50M Cash App users* who do not use Afterpay while retaining your current Afterpay shoppers.

The new Afterpay assets for your site incorporate proven messaging and design to acquire Cash App users and continue transacting with Afterpay users. 

Merchants who update Afterpay throughout their site will benefit from incremental sales and new customers from our total network. 

_\* Definitions & Source: A Cash App active is defined as a monthly transacting active user with at least one transaction monthly. Actives eligible for Afterpay include account owners who are 18+ and non-business accounts as of 2024._

---

#### Is this change related to Cash App for Business?

No. Cash App for Business is a product that enables small, often single proprietor businesses to set up a business profile  to accept Cash App payments.

---

#### Do I need a new Cash App Pay merchant account?

No. This update gives you access to Cash App customers through the existing Afterpay experience. You just need to update the brand - no other changes are needed.

---

#### Will my integration need to be recertified?

Merchants with existing integrations will receive seamless updates, and Afterpay will complete all certifications before updates are made. We expect merchants will have minimal or no involvement with these changes, depending on how merchants displayed Afterpay.

---

#### Are my existing Afterpay customers automatically enrolled into the experience change?

The checkout experience will not change for the existing Afterpay customers. These customers will use the same login credentials, see the same checkout experience, and continue to service all orders via Afterpay.

---

#### Are updates to my “learn more” lightbox asset necessary? What do I need to update in order to remain in compliance?

---

#### I haven't been able to transact with Afterpay, as the Afterpay Messaging is no longer visible on my website. What can I do before I can take advantage of attracting new Cash App users?

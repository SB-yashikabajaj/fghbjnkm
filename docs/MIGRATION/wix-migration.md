# Wix Migration

No action is needed. The brand updates automatically appear when the migration from Afterpay to Cash App Afterpay occurs. See the [FAQ](faq-migration.md) for when this migration will occur. 

<!-- theme: info -->
> **Note**
>
> *Cash App Afterpay* may appear as *Afterpay* on the administration page of the Wix website.

## Brand Assets

There are new Cash App Afterpay brand assets to use at checkout and across your site. See the [Brand Assets](../MARKETING/Brand-Assets.md) page in this guide for these new assets.

The table below has examples of the changes:

| | Afterpay | Cash App Afterpay |
-------|----------|---------
| Logos | <img src="../../assets/images/ap-logo-resized.png" style="all: unset; width: 150px;" /> | <img src="../../assets/images/caap-white-logo-resized.png" style="all: unset; width: 150px;" />
| Buttons | <img src="../../assets/images/ap-button.png" style="all: unset; width: 200px;" /> | <img src="../../assets/images/caap-button.png" style="all: unset; width: 200px;" /> |

## Messaging

Messaging is automatically updated if you use On-Site Messaging, our current messaging product, or its predecessor that used the JavaScript library for messaging. In both cases wait for the automatic update process to occur. Monitor your email for advance notice of this automatic update.

See the table below for an example of the changes:

| Afterpay | Cash App Afterpay
|----------|---------
| <img src="../../assets/images/ap-mess-2.png" style="all: unset; width: 250px;" /> | <img src="../../assets/images/caap-mess-1.png" style="all: unset; width: 250px;" /> |

The automatic Messaging update includes changes to *learn more*/lightbox asset if you use that.

If you use elements of Afterpay Messaging but not the standard Onsite Messaging Widget, then update the Afterpay elements with new Cash App Afterpay elements. See the [Brand Assets](#brand-assets) section above.

Any custom messaging updates must be reviewed by your Account Manager.

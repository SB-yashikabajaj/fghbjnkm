# Express checkout reference

## Sequence diagram

Express checkout has similar behaviour across both deferred and integrated shipping. The sequence diagram below shows a high-level checkout sequence for a customer using integrated shipping.

```

1. A customer (consumer) chooses _Checkout with Cash App Afterpay Express_ from the shopping cart or product.
2. The merchant calls the _Create Order_ or _Create Checkout_ endpoint, passing an option to enable dynamic pricing in the Express Checkout. 
3. The merchant uses the token in combination with the Javascript `afterpay.js` to direct the customer through the Cash App Afterpay Express checkout flow using the popup method. See the [Setup](Setup-ec.md) page.
4. The customer enters Express Checkout and selects the shipping address they want from their existing Cash App Afterpay details.
5. Cash App Afterpay calls the `onShippingAddressChange()` callback function on the merchant site to retrieve all shipping options and taxes for the chosen address.
6. The customer selects the shipping method and the order total, including the payment schedule, is updated to include the relevant shipping and taxes.
7. The customer confirms their Cash App Afterpay order and Cash App Afterpay notifies the merchant using the `onComplete()` callback function.
8. The merchant verifies the transaction by fetching the Order from Cash App Afterpay and comparing it to their own records.
9. The merchant shows the customer a confirmation page (optional).
10. The customer confirms their order. The merchant calls Cash App Afterpay to capture the payment, passing the calculated order amount for verification.

```json
AfterPay.initializeForPopup({
  countryCode: 'US',
  onCommenceCheckout: function(actions) {
    /* retrieve cash app afterpay token from your server */
    /* then call `actions.resolve(token)` */
  },
  onShippingAddressChange: function (data, actions) {
    /* required for Integrated Shipping  */
    /* address in `data` */
    /* calc options, then call `actions.resolve(options)` */
  },
  onShippingOptionChange: function (data) {
    /* optional - chosen option in `data` */
  },
  onComplete: function (data) {
    /* handle success/failure of checkout */
  },
  target: '#afterpay-express-button',
  buyNow: false,
  pickup: false,
  shippingOptionRequired: true
})
```
> **Note**
>
> Integrated Shipping is enabled by default for Express orders. To disable it, set `shippingOptionRequired` to false.

## Security - postMessage()

`afterpay.js` uses the HTML `postMessage()` API to exchange information between the Cash App Afterpay checkout popup and the page that spawned it. This allows Javascript code running on different origins to communicate with each other in a bidirectional manner.

The bidirectional communication allows a merchant to dynamically update shipping options and transaction information based on a chosen shipping address.

`afterpay.js` hides this complexity and restricts the use of `postMessage()` to ensure a secure environment. Specifically:

- Cash App Afterpay’s checkout window only receives messages from the merchant window, and vice versa

- Correctly handles multiple concurrent, and possibly out-of-order requests

- Message data is validated and sanitized

Using `postMessage()` in this way is considered very secure. For more information please refer to the [specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage).

# Overview
Afterpay’s Online Card API allows merchants to create Afterpay orders as they would through our standard API, but receive a single-use virtual card number or token per successful order. This allows merchants to handle authorization, capture, and refunds using the card itself, eliminating the need to integrate with Afterpay’s additional endpoints for that.

# What is Cash App Pay and What is Cash App Afterpay?

To avoid confusion, it is important to understand the difference between **Cash App Pay** and **Cash App Afterpay**.

## Key Differences

* **Cash App Pay** is a payment method that allows customers to pay for goods or services in a single transaction

* **Cash App Afterpay** is a payment method that lets customers pay for goods or services in installments

### Cash App Pay

Cash App Pay is a digital payment feature. It allows users to make secure, contactless payments in stores or online directly from their Cash App balance or linked bank accounts. Cash App Pay is an e-wallet primarily used on mobile devices, though it can also be accessed on a desktop or laptop.

### Cash App Afterpay

Cash App Afterpay is a buy now, pay later service that allows both Afterpay and now Cash App customers in the US to purchase goods and services online and pay in installments. 

The Pay-in-4 feature allows customers to pay with four interest-free installments paid every six weeks. For example, if a customer buys a $100 product they make the first $25 installment at the time of purchase. Then they make three further $25 payments at two-week intervals. 

Cash App Afterpay is only available to US merchants. In Australia and New Zealand, our buy now, pay later solution is called Afterpay. In the United Kingdom, it is called Clearpay.

# Cross Border Trade

Cross Border Trade is a feature that enables you to accept Cash App Afterpay orders from international customers. 

For example, if you have a US online store, you can accept orders from customers in Australia and those customers can use Cash App Afterpay.

<!-- theme: info -->
> **Note**
>
> Afterpay customers can still make CBT purchases. Cash App customers that are new to Afterpay will not see options to use CBT.

## Available Countries

The available countries for Cash App Afterpay Cross Border Trade are:

* Australia

* Canada

* New Zealand

* United Kingdom (as Clearpay)

## Setup

All Cash App Afterpay merchants have Cross Border Trade enabled automatically.

## Actions

Please ensure that your store is configured to meet these requirements:

**Currency**

Check that your store currency matches your Cash App Afterpay merchant account region. For example, if you have a US Cash App Afterpay merchant account, then your store currency must be set to USD. If the two do not match, Cash App Afterpay will not work.

**Store Address**

Check that your store address matches your Cash App Afterpay merchant account region. For example, if you have a US Cash App Afterpay merchant account, then your store address must be set to United States. 

For information on how to set or change your store currency or address, go to the [Platforms - Quickstart](../PLATFORMS/Platforms-Quickstart.md) topic and choose your platform from the list.

**Shipping**

You must configure shipping methods to any countries that you want to offer CBT to. So for example, if you have a US store and offer CBT to New Zealand, you would need to configure shipping methods for New Zealand within your platform's shipping settings. If you do not do this, international customers will not be able to place an order.

## Settlements

Settlements from Cash App Afterpay are always paid in your local currency. So, if you are a US merchant, your settlements are made in US dollars.

## Restrictions and Costs

You cannot display Cash App Afterpay messaging on the product pages for currencies other than the default store currency. This is due to possible exchange rate variations, which could lead to inaccurate installment amounts.

Cash App Afterpay charges a small additional fee on Cross Border Trade transactions. For details of this fee, see your Cash App Afterpay contract or email us at:

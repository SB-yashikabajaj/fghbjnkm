# Familiar with Afterpay

If you're familiar with Afterpay and already use it on your site(s) then **Cash App Afterpay** offers you more:

* More customers 

* One seamless experience for Afterpay and Cash App customers

For the first time ever, Afterpay is accessible to Cash App customers through a single, seamless checkout experience, Cash App Afterpay. This means we're changing how Afterpay appears on your site. 

This change should retain your Afterpay shoppers and attract many new Cash App users. There are plenty of Cash App users; over 50 million incremental active users will now have access to Afterpay.

Cash App Afterpay incorporates proven messaging and design to appeal to both Cash App users and Afterpay users. Merchants who update Afterpay throughout their site will benefit from an incremental sales boost and new customers from our total network.

>
> Cash App Afterpay is for US merchants and partners only.

## Whatâ€™s Changing?

The new Cash App Afterpay product is designed to have little to no effect on your back-end operations, payment processing, settlement or other technical processes. 

Instead there are visual changes to the Afterpay logo and messaging on your product pages. Your customers will notice different payment options are available to them on your product and checkout pages.

To integrate with the new product, see the following sections:
